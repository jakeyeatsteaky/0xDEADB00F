### Rendering Game Objects

- Game objects are stored in a vector of unique pointers in the App class.
- Each of these objects will have to initialize a struct of "RenderData" which is from the Rendering Engine Library.  
- That renderdata is stored on the rendering library side, and is used to render all the objects.
